Cypress Automation for OrangeHRM

**Intro:**
This project is an extensive Cypress automation suite for the OrangeHRM platform. It encompasses a variety of end-to-end (E2E) testing scenarios to ensure robust performance and user experience. The suite leverages Cypress's powerful features to simulate real user interactions and validate application behavior.

**Main functions/tasks:**
- **Cypress Assertions**: Utilizes Cypress's built-in assertion library to validate UI elements, network calls, and application states.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implements POM for maintainable and reusable code structure, enhancing test readability and efficiency.
- **Actions**: Simulates real user actions like clicking, typing, and hovering to interact with web elements.
- **Dynamic Dropdowns**: Tests dynamic dropdown menus to ensure they populate and behave correctly.
- **Reporting**: Integrates with Cypress Dashboard for clear and insightful reporting of test results.
- **Hooks**: Uses Cypress hooks (`before`, `beforeEach`, `after`, `afterEach`) for test suite setup and teardown processes.
- **E2E Flows**: Includes several E2E test flows on OrangeHRM, covering typical user interactions and edge cases.
- **iFrames Handling**: Demonstrates techniques to interact with and test content within iFrames.
- **Real Mouse Events**: Captures and asserts the behavior of the application in response to actual mouse events.

**How to import and reuse:**
